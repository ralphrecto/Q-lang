# Q-lang
I've always wanted to build my own programming language. Since I implemented a bajillion interpreters in CS 4110 for Fall 2014, I think it's time to try a (small) compiler.

## Implementation roadmap

  * Stage 1: lexing/parsing (current)
  * Stage 2: CPS conversion
  * Stage 3: Closure conversion
  * Stage 4: stack-based compilation to MIPS subset (?)

## current TODOs
  * learn how to use a makefile...
  * robustify lexing/parsing (e.g. add parens, etc.)
